      p Our programs have documented success at teaching manageable behavior modification and anger management techniques, which reduce the stress associated with poor self esteem related to fitness and health.
      p We students achieve their goals and set new heights everyday. While every student has their success story, it's impossible to shine a light on all of them. With that recognition, we'd like to share stories of a select few students with you:
      div(class="story")
        h2(style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.500em; line-height: 1.500em;") Dante Exum
        img(src="/images/im.png", alt="Success Story", style="margin: 5px; float: left; display: block; height: 300px; width: auto;") 
        p Testing early not only helps to establish a Benchmark for athletes to see where they're at, but it's also used to compare them against other top pro athletes from our database of 6 years of NBA testing.
        p Dante Exum was a talented 17yr old teenager from Australia looking to go to college. His parents were looking into colleges when he tested at one of our BAM Europe events for Adidas. His BAM test scores were so high that NBA general managers were startled and his stock rose! 
        p Forget college, Dante! You're headed to the NBA! He was drafted the #5 Pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.
