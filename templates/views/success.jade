        p Testing early not only helps to establish a Benchmark for athletes to see where they're at, but it's also used to compare them against other top pro athletes from our database of 6 years of NBA testing.
        p Dante Exum was a talented 17yr old teenager from Australia looking to go to college. His parents were looking into colleges when he tested at one of our BAM Europe events for Adidas. His BAM test scores were so high that NBA general managers were startled and his stock rose! 
        p Forget college, Dante! You're headed to the NBA! He was drafted the #5 Pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.
