    p We host regional and national events for athletes looking to break out and gain exposure needed for colelge scholarships and pro contracts. Even more importantly, pro teams and NCAA are using our data for "#[i Benchmarking]" (a way to develope baselines scores to improve and compare against other top athletes for training).
    p Everyone will have an opportunity to compare their #[b BAM] score against the best athletes from around the country. Your scores will be available in 48 hours! The #[ top 50] athletes in each group will be automatically ranked and invited to regionals in december!
    p Don't miss an opportunity to be tested using the same technology the NBA, Adidas Nations, NBA Europe, D-League and every foreign professional team, scouts, coaches and general managers use to validate and select their players!

        img(src="/images/im.png", alt="Success Story", style="margin: 5px; float: left; display: block; height: 300px; width: auto;") 
        p Testing early not only helps to establish a Benchmark for athletes to see where they're at, but it's also used to compare them against other top pro athletes from our database of 6 years of NBA testing.
        p Dante Exum was a talented 17yr old teenager from Australia looking to go to college. His parents were looking into colleges when he tested at one of our BAM Europe events for Adidas. His BAM test scores were so high that NBA general managers were startled and his stock rose! 
        p Forget college, Dante! You're headed to the NBA! He was drafted the #5 Pick in the 2014 NBA Draft.
